title: Installing Solar Through Tesla
---

We've wanted solar for at least the past 5 years.  We even went so far as to get quotes 5 years ago and then decided against it when we didn't feel we were going to be able to secure as good a deal as we were hoping we could get.  We weighed options of financing and leasing and nothing seemed right for the long term.  We're refinancing our house, and we had built up plenty of equity so at this point solar seemed like a great idea.

When we previously looked at solar, the best deal at the time we were able to find was a 12.48 kW system leased from SunRun that would be leased over the course of 20 years.  The total cost after all was said and done was going to e $48k.  I could prepay the lease for $31k, or buy it outright for $52k.  This did not include any batteries, it was a solar array only.

Contrast that to the option I've recently selected with Tesla.  Now granted, prices have gone down a small bit for solar, however using a cash-out refi to pay for solar if you have a damn good interest rate is the optimal way to get the most bang for your buck.  I opted to go with Tesla's 12.24 kW system with 2 Powerwall batteries.  Using the cash payment option and getting the federal tax credits brings the net cost down to just about $29K.  Estimated finance charges by rolling it into the mortgage is about $13k for a total cost of $42k.  Over the course of 20 years, that comes out to about $175/month, at least $50/month cheaper than my current average electric bill.  That savings will only grow over time!

It was easy to get started with Tesla.  All you have to do is [visit their website](https://ts.la/matt16062) (referral link; you'll get $100 back after activation), fill out your address and average monthly electric bill and then you can configure your system and payment options.  Tesla selects the system they think is most optimal based on your electric bill.  In my case it was the 12.24 kW system.  I added the Powerwall option as well.  It defaulted to three; I updated it to two.

I entered my contact information and credit card info ($100 non-refundable deposit) and I was ready.

After submitting the application, I was immediately able to start the virtual home assessment via Tesla's website.  I was asked about various features of my home and then prompted on subsequent screens to upload pictures of things like my roof, electrical panel, garage and A/C system.

### Friday, September 4th, 2020

I received an email and text from Ariana with Tesla Solar introducing herself and advising me that the design of my system was underway.  She was able to quickly answer a few questions that I had around HOA approvals and timelines and then I was all set to wait for the design.

Later on in the evening, I received the initial design.  The design document sent over included specs on the SolarEdge inverter, [Q.PEAK DUO panels](https://www.energysage.com/solar-panels/q-cells/2091/qpeak-duo-blk-g6-335/) and Powerwalls.  In reviewing the initial design document, there was a note that the layout of the system did not match the order (layout was 11.9 kW, or 35 panels instead of the full 36) due to utility prohibitions.  

I did some digging into [APS's rules around solar](https://www.aps.com/en/Residential/Service-Plans/Compare-Service-Plans/Renewable-Energy-Riders#RCPExportRider) and found that there are two restrictions in play for my property: I have a 200 amp main breaker so I'm capped at a 15 kW system; and since I'm looking at a system greater than 10 kW, I'm capped at 1.5x my highest 1 hour demand in the last 12 months.  Up until my latest bill, my largest billed demand was 8 kW, therefore capping me at a 12 kW system.  

Fortunately, my latest bill that was about to be sent out had a demand of 8.36 kW, capping me at 12.54 kW system, allowing me to go with the full 36 panels.  I emailed Ariana and asked if this demand could be used instead before signing off on the design and waited to hear back.

Ariana emailed back and let me know that they could only use the amount once it was billed out.  I let her know that the bill should be out by the week's end and I would forward it a long to her once I got it.

APS billed out and the new 12-month high demand charge was on it.  I downloaded the PDF and sent it off to Ariana.

### Thursday, September 10th, 2020

Ariana emailed back and asked to upload some detailed usage details from my APS account so they could see if this was indeed my highest or (I assume) if there was anything higher that might allow them to go with a slightly larger system.  I downloaded the usage and emailed it back to her.  She confirmed they could do 36 panels and submitted a request for a redesign.

### Tuesday, September 15th, 2020

I reached out to follow up with Ariana to check on the status of the redesign.  She had previously mentioend that we were up against a September 30th deadline to submit the application to take advantage of APS's current export rate (currently $0.1045/kWh).

Ariana replied back that the design team is running 1-2 weeks out due to a backlog.  She also asked for an additional photo of my pool subpanel which I replied with.

### Wednesday, September 16th, 2020

Ariana confirmed receipt of the images and that she had uploaded them for the design team.

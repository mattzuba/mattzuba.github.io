We've wanted solar for at least the past 5 years.  We even went so far as to get quotes 5 years ago and then decided against it when we didn't feel we were going to be able to secure as good a deal as we were hoping we could get.  We weighed options of financing and leasing and nothing seemed right for the long term.  We're refinancing our house, and we had built up plenty of equity so at this point solar seemed like a great idea with prices as they are.

When we previously looked at solar, the best deal at the time we were able to find was a 12.48 kW system from SunRun that would be leased over the course of 20 years.  The total cost after all was said and done was going to be $48k.  I could prepay the lease for $31k, or buy it outright for $52k (before credits).  This did not include any batteries, it was a solar array only.

Contrast that to the option I've recently selected with Tesla.  Now granted, prices have gone down a small bit for solar, however using our cash-out refi to pay for solar was the optimal way to get the most bang for our buck.  I opted to go with Tesla's 12.24 kW system with 2 Powerwall batteries.  Using the cash payment option and getting the tax credits brings the net cost down to just about $27K.  Estimated finance charges by rolling it into the mortgage is about $12k for a total cost of about $39k.  Over the course of 20 years, that comes out to about $160/month, at least $75/month cheaper than my current average electric bill.  That savings will only grow over time!

It was easy to get started with Tesla.  All you have to do is [visit their website](https://www.tesla.com/energy/design?referral=matt16062) (referral link; you'll get $100 back after system activation), fill out your address and average monthly electric bill and then you can configure your system and payment options.  Tesla selects the system they think is most optimal based on your electric bill.  In my case it was the 12.24 kW system.  I added the Powerwall option as well.  It defaulted to three; I decreased it to two.  Of course the system size Tesla selects for you is an estimate.  Since you don't have that door-to-door salesman coming up and explaining everything, you'll need to do some research and determine what system size will end up working best for your needs and be most cost effective for you.

I entered my contact information and credit card info ($100 non-refundable deposit) and placed my order.

After submitting the application, I was immediately able to start the virtual home assessment via Tesla's website.  I was asked about various features of my home and then prompted on subsequent screens to upload pictures of things like my roof, electrical panel, garage and A/C system.

### Friday, September 4th, 2020

I received an email and text from Ariana with Tesla Solar introducing herself and advising me that the design of my system was underway.  She was able to quickly answer a few questions that I had around HOA approvals and timelines and then I was all set to wait for the design.

Later on in the evening, I received the initial design.  The design document sent over included specs on the [SolarEdge Inverter](https://www.solaredge.com/us/products/pv-inverter/single-phase#/), [Q.PEAK DUO panels](https://www.energysage.com/solar-panels/q-cells/2091/qpeak-duo-blk-g6-335/) and [Powerwalls](https://www.tesla.com/powerwall).  In reviewing the initial design document, there was a note that the layout of the system did not match the order (layout was 11.9 kW, or 35 panels instead of the full 36) due to utility prohibitions.  

I did some digging into [APS's rules around solar](https://www.aps.com/en/Residential/Service-Plans/Compare-Service-Plans/Renewable-Energy-Riders#RCPExportRider) and found that there are two restrictions in play for my property: I have a 200 amp main breaker so I'm capped at a 15 kW system; and since I'm looking at a system greater than 10 kW, I'm capped at 1.5x my highest 1 hour demand in the last 12 months.  Up until my latest bill, my largest billed demand was 8 kW, therefore capping me at a 12 kW system.  

Fortunately, my latest bill that was about to be sent out had a demand of 8.36 kW, capping me at 12.54 kW system, thus allowing me to go with the full 36 panels.  A few days later my billing cycle was up and I sent the newest bill with demand to Ariana so they could redesign with the full 36 panels.

### Tuesday, September 29th, 2020

Got an email from Ariana and a notice from Tesla that new documents were available for me to review; including the revised design with all 36 panels, some APS documents to sign and a few other things.  I signed all of the documents and then downloaded a copy of the design to submit to my HOA's architectural committee.

The design ended up with 14 panels (4.76 kW) on the east face of the roof and 22 panels (7.48 kW) on the west.  [PVWatts](https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/pvwatts.php) estimates this will output 7700 kWh/year and 12073 kWh/year, respectively, for a total of 19773 kWh/year.  Not far off from the first year estimate from Tesla of 18910 kWh.

### Thursday, October 1st, 2020

I received approval from the HOA for the Solar project.

### Tuesday, October 20th, 2020

Tesla completed the electrical plans and determined they would be able to accommodate whole-home backup with the two Powerwall batteries based on the loads in my electrical panel!  I was sent the plans to review (which is awesome, because I like learning how this stuff works) and I received an email from APS seeking authorization for Tesla to submit applications on my behalf.  I signed the paperwork (Docusign) and let my rep know they were good to move forward on their end.

Two days later, I received a notice from APS that an interconnection application had been submitted.

In reviewing the design document, I was pleasantly surprised to see that Tesla was including [SolarEdge Power Optimizers](https://www.solaredge.com/us/products/power-optimizer) in the design as well.  These weren't on the initial plans but I'm happy to see them included here.

### Tuesday, October 27th, 2020

After a few days of back and forth between Tesla and APS, APS has approved the installation plans.

### Monday, November 9th, 2020

I've been assigned a new Project Advisor, Alessandra, as Ariana has moved to a new role in Tesla Auto.  Ariana also let me know they're expecting city permits to be issued sometime around Thanksgiving week.

### Monday, December 7th, 2020

Permits were issued by the city and installation has been scheduled for January 25th.  I'm now following up with Tesla on what happens with the 4% decrease in the Federal ITC.  In early November, there was a notice on Tesla's site indicating that Tesla would provide a rebate of 4% to cover the decrease if they couldn't schedule installation prior to the end of the year provided all documents were in prior to December 1st.

### Sunday, December 27th, 2020

The above issue regarding the tax credit is now moot.  Included in the [Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/133) passed by Congress and signed into law by President Trump today is a provision to extend the Solar Investment Tax Credit at 26% through December 31, 2022.  Now we simply await the installation!

### Saturday, January 23rd, 2021 - INSTALLATION BEGINS!!!

I got a call from Tesla Solar Scheduling yesterday, and they asked if they could start the installation today and finish on Monday.  The weather isn't looking so good for Monday but there was a bit of a reprieve today, so they wanted to get the panels up on the roof.  The installation team arrived bright and early at 7:15a to begin their work.  They were pretty quick and got 26 of the 36 panels racked up on the roof.  The other 10 (not enough power optimizers on hand), the electrical and the Powerwalls will wait until Monday morning.

### Monday, January 25th, 2021

Day 2 of the installation.  It was pretty wet outside and there was only a short 2-3 hours when rain wasn't expected, so the Powerwall crew was called off for the day.  The Solar crew was able to finish a majority of their work except for testing and painting the conduit on the roof.

### Saturday, January 30th, 2021

Day 3 of installation.  No rain, a mostly cloud-less day, and perfect for finishing the installation of the system.  

The Powerwall crew arrived right on time at 7a and got to work.  They cut power to the house at 7:50 which gave me time to shut down computers and network equipment.  To my surprise, these guys moved quick; power was restored by 10am!  They continued their work for about another two hours, completing the wiring of the Powerwall batteries and getting the Tesla Energy Gateway (TEG) wired up.  They completed their work shortly before noon and with some capacity in each battery already, did a test of killing grid power and letting the batteries take over.  As expected, the lights flickered briefly as the Powerwall batteries took over.  My face lit up!

Just as the Powerwall crew was finishing up, the Solar crew returned to complete their work; painting conduit, connecting solar to the TEG and then performing their test to ensure all panels were recognized by the inverter and that power was flowing to the house and grid.

### Thursday, February 4, 2021

Tesla texted yesterday to schedule the city inspection and as luck would have it, there was an opening for today.  The inspector arrived at 9:30 and green-tagged the installation!  Now to wait for the APS inspection and Permission To Operate (PTO).
